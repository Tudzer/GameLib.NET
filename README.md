## Description

GameLib.NET is a library to give .NET developers easy access to the users installed game launchers and installed games. The motivation for the library is a tool I'm currently working on which requires access to all game executables on a PC.

While this repository is providing already the tools to gather the games from the most common game launchers, it easily extendible via the MEF Framework.

The base library detects  following game launchers including their installed games:
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com)
- [Ubisoft Connect](https://ubisoftconnect.com/)
- [Origin](https://www.origin.com/)
- [GOG Galaxy 2.0](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)
